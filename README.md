Hello, my name is José and I am taking a Master degree in Electrotechnical Engineering and Computers, majoring in Computation Systems at Instituto Superior Técnico.

I'm interested in sports, e-sports and of course technology, namely anything involving computation systems and machine learning. I'm comfortable programming in multiple languages (C, Python, Matlab, CUDA) and always willing to learn new ones. At the moment I am learning Systems Programming and Deep Learning.
